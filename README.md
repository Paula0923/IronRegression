![Housing and Regression by ChatGPT](Images/housing_and_regression.webp)

## Overview
In this project, we analyze a dataset of house sale prices for King County, including Seattle, spanning one year from May 2014 to May 2015.  Our main goal is to analyze which features best explain the prices of houses. We do this with a regression analysis.
